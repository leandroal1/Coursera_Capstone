            "source": "Every year hundreds of students from around the world conduct school exchanges in the city of Toronto.\nThey are people from the most different kinds of cities, and most of them don't have a clue about what is to live in Toronto.\nTypically, college students desire to live in places near bus stops, subway stations, convenience stores, markets, and preferably close to the university. \nWith this in mind, I intend to use Foursquare API data to indicate the most suitable neighborhoods to live in during the exchange.\nAlso, I want to rank the neighborhoods with the highest crime rates, that maybe newbies in the city should take extra care.\n\n\nThis project helps the end user to not only recommend but also saves a lot of time in manual search. This will save the time and money of the user. It can be used by the user at the time of rental apartment or buy house in a locality based on the distribution of various facilities available around the neighborhood. As an example, this project would compare neighborhoods and analyses the top 10 most suitable, based at the distribution of Bus Stations, Bus Stops, Convenience Stores, Train Stations, Markets, Parks, Pharmacys, Supermarkets and Universitys. Also, this project uses K-means clustering unsupervised machine learning algorithm to cluster the neighborhoods based on the venues distribution such as restaurants, park, coffee shop, gym, clubs etc. This would give a better understanding of the similarities and dissimilarities between the neighborhoods to retrieve more insights and to conclude with ease which neighborhood will be more suitable.",
